## Shallow copy vs Deep copy

### Default / Shallow copy constructor

    + memberwise copy
    + Each data member is copied from the source object
    + The pointer is copied NOT what it points to ( shallow copy )
    + **Problem : when we release the storage in the destructor, the other object still refer to the released storage !**


### Deep copy

    + Create a copy of the pointed-to data
    + Each copy will have a pointer to unique storage in the heap
    + Deep copy when you have a raw pointer as a class data member
