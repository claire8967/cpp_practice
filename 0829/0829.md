## Shallow copy vs Deep copy

### Default copy constructor

    + memberwise copy
    + Each data member is copied from the source object
    + The pointer is copied NOT what it points to ( shallow copy )
    + **Problem : when we release the storage in the destructor, the other object still refer to the released storage !**
